This is a project I did for an interview. The objective was to predict the next year of vehicle sales beyond November 2019 using data from the FRED database.
I used a sinusoidal regression technique that fit a variable sine wave to the existing data, and used the regression of the yearly max and min values to determine the 
amplitude of the prediction wave.
